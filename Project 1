  <h1>A Century of Artists by Priscilla Cevallos</h1>

  <h2>Lois Mailou Jones, 1905 to 1998</h2>

<p>Artist and educator, Lois Mailou Jones created art that surpassed her time in the 20th Century for decades. Inspired by her visits to Paris, her marriage to artist Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noel, and the Harlem Renascence, she produced lively works that showcased the beauty of her race. Her bright abstract paintings and textiles featured African-themed patterns and colors. Jones not only created abstracts but portraits and landscapes as well. During her long career as an artist, she also served as a cultural ambassador to Africa in 1970 as a part of the United States Information Agency. Jones’ career is ever influential now and for centuries to come.</p>

  <h2>Jean-Michel Basquiat, 1960 to 1988</h2>

<p>Young contemporary artist, Jean-Michel Basquiat had a short but significant art career. His career began with graffiti in the streets of New York and evolved into large abstract paintings. After being found by the booming art world in the 1980s he produced many paintings and drawings. His artwork set a precedent for street-style art for decades to come. Basquiat’s career was cut short after a sudden death to a drug overdose. His art is widespread to this day to be found on common items such as shoes, other accessories, and clothing.</p>

  <h2>Kehinde Wiley, 1977 to present</h2>

<p>Best known for his painted portrait of the 44th president, Barack Obama, Kehinde Wiley’s paintings resemble a modern version of the Old Masters’ during the 1800s. These “Old Masters” are those painters during the 1800s who were commissioned to create portraits of rich aristocrats at the time. Wiley modernized this concept mimicking such artworks and replacing the subjects with current famous black individuals. A list of remasterted works that Wiley has created are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Napoleon Leading the Army over the Alps</li>
  <li>Charles I</li>
  <li>Equestrian Portrait of King Philip II</li>
  <li>Alexander the Great</li>
</ul>
